# Canonical projects of web faculty

The projects are based on the theory and practical tasks on the platform and don't take account of extra materials shared by tutors.

*NOTE: This approach to project might come across as not optimal. But it matches the current task given the current level of student knowledge.
Some code fragments contain comments with suggestions on improvement and optimization, as well as alternative solutions.*
